                    YouTube content should be primarily focused on a video format. Providing educational value and
                    practical know-how to users can increase a traffic across all SoMe platforms. Content for this
                    platform should be both value oriented with high focus on delivering practical knowledge but it also
                    has to be served in a way that will satisfy a viewer. Each video should besides of it’s main value,
                    should contain an encouragement to further interaction across other platforms. Comment section
                    should also not be underestimated as it is able to help in a process of building a strong community.
                    Everything posted on YouTube should remain consistent with an official branding and tone of voice as
                    authenticity is highly valued.

                <h2>Adobe Illustrator tutorial</h2>

                <h3>Title: Create an animal logo - Adobe Illustrator for beginners</h3>

                <h3>Hashtags: #ICDesignChallenge #ICDesignTutorials #ICDesign #Illustrator #GraphicDesign</h3>
                <p>
                    Thumbnail: pink background, title of the video on the center left with purple and white font
                    color,
                    Adobe
                    Illustrator icon at the top left, relevant Illustrator screenshot on the center right (along
                    with
                    the title,
                    the
                    most dominant element in the image)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goal: The purpose of the video is to teach Illustrator beginners how to create from scratch a
                    vector
                    logo
                    with a
                    motif of an animal and afterwards motivate them to share their end results on Instagram using a
                    specific
                    hashtag
                    and tagging Ioana’s Instagram account. This would boost SoMe engagement and potentially enlarge
                    her
                    follower
                    base on Instagram using UGC startegy.

                <p>
                    Intro - Ioana greets the viewers, introduces herself, says her full name and a name of her
                    brand/company
                    name.
                    Then she proceeds to display the end result that she will try to recreate in the rest of the
                    video - a
                    vector
                    logo created in Adobe Illustrator which features a figure or a head of a specific animal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Demonstration - the rest of the video uses screen recordings of Adobe Illustrator
                    demonstrations, showing
                    the
                    step-by-step process of logo creation. Each recording is accompanied with audio of Ioana
                    describing the
                    presented step of the process. If necessary, a video clip of a step can be paused in order for
                    Ioana to have
                    enough time to explain what she does and why. This approach is repeated until the entire process
                    is over and
                    Ioana has the entire logo completed on screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenge - In order to spread the brand awareness and boost her social following on Instagram,
                    in the
                    following
                    clip Ioana shows the screen recording of her Instagram account and she mentions to her viewers
                    how they too
                    can
                    share their variation of a logo with an animal motif on instagram, either in a form of a post or
                    an
                    instagram
                    story. The way they would do this is by using a hashtag #ICDesignChallenge as well as tagging
                    her Instagram
                    account, which username she would mention and display in the video. To motivate her viewers,
                    Ioana would say
                    that the best three submissions would earn a shoutout and secret surprise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conclusion - Ioana signs off, thanks her viewers for watching and reminds them to like, comment

                    to her channel as a whole. This way Ioana can build a community out of her follower base.</p>
